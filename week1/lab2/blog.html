        <p>The Rule of Space in Photography: A Comprehensive Guide (+ Examples)</p>
        <P>Adding depth
            The rule of space in photography is not limited to highly active subjects; it works for stationary subject matter, too!
            
            For example, in portraiture, your composition can be governed by pairing the gaze or gesticulations of the subject with negative space. A subject’s gaze naturally directs our attention – we want to see what the subject sees.
            
            But when a gaze is met by negative space, the viewer’s eye will often naturally return to the original source of the gaze. The rule of space provides an organic way of adding depth and directing viewer attention.
            
            You can also use the rule of space with non-human/animal subject matter – based on their movement, perceived gesticulations, and extensions. By following the momentum, composition, or behavior of a non-human subject, you’ll find ideal placements for negative space.
            
            In the example below, I surrounded several blossoms with negative space; this additional room suggests growth and depth. It also highlights the detail in the individual florets.

            Rule of space challenges
            The process of applying the rule of space to photographs is not that difficult in itself. However, a tendency to cram each image with as much visual information as possible can get in the way of exploring negative space.
            
            Instead, deliberately and mindfully take a minimalist approach. You can also zoom out or physically take a few steps back from a subject to refocus on the rule of space.
            
            Tips and techniques for working with the rule of space
            Here are a few tips for working with the rule of space:
            
            Tip 1: Use other compositional rules, too
            Applying the rule of space to your photography doesn’t have to come at the cost of other compositional rules.
            
            In fact, combining compositional tenets with the rule of space in photography can increase the chances of creating a successful photograph.
            
            Compositional rules such as the rule of thirds, leading lines, depth of field, and repetition can all be used in conjunction with the rule of space to create engaging imagery.

        <h3>How to build an ultimate Landscape Photography Filter Kit
        </h3>
        <small>Posted by Fariha Rajput on 12th</small>
        <p>Landscape5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines Landscape. The term represents two different concepts.
            It is a new At its very heart, landscape photography is about capturing light on a sensor (or film, if you’re still shooting the old-fashioned way). Besides camera settings, photography filters are the only accessory available to a landscape photographer to control and modify that light. Photography filters allow a landscape photographer to explore creativity, control colors, reduce glare, manage dynamic range and more. So it is important to carry the ultimate landscape photography kit with you when you travel to exotic locations. What makes an ultimate landscape photography photography filter kit?

            If you are just starting to think about getting photography filters, the process can be confusing due to the many options that are available in the market today. You will have to think about the size of the front element of your camera lenses, type of photography filters to get, size of the photography filters and number of other factors. So just how does one go about building an ultimate landscape photography filter kit? To answer this question let’s first look at what the landscape photography filters used for.
            
            Understanding Photography Filters
            The first thing you need to learn about filters is what they do and how they affect your images. This helps determine which filters to purchase and how to use them effectively to capture photos like this one from Iceland.
            
            Circular Polarizer Filter
            A circular polarizer is the first filter I would purchase. This photography filter reduces or removes the glare from a reflective surface caused by scattered light. While there are plenty of  circular polarizer effects software presets, there is no way for software to accurately reproduce the effects of a circular polarizer. You can see the effect of a circular polarizer in the images below.
